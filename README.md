# MIS-310-IA-1

This Python script contains two simple problems designed to practice user input, basic arithmetic operations, and formatted output.

In Problem 1 – BMI, the program asks the user for their weight in pounds and height in inches. It then calculates the Body Mass Index (BMI) in two ways: using the imperial formula (`BMI = (weight / height²) * 703`) and using the metric formula by first converting pounds to kilograms and inches to meters, then computing `BMI = weight_kg / height_m²`. Both BMI values are rounded to one decimal place and printed with clear labels.

In Problem 2 – Vehicle Routing, the program prompts the user for the total travel time in hours and the average speed in miles per hour. It multiplies these values to compute the total distance traveled in miles and displays the result in a formatted sentence. A final comment notes that, in this simple scenario, the shortest route type is assumed to be a local route.
